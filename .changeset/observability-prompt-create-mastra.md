Add "Enable Mastra Observability? (will open auth flow)" prompt to `create-mastra` and `mastra init`.

When the user opts in, the CLI runs the interactive browser login flow (if not already authenticated), lets them pick an existing project or create a new one, mints a fresh organization access token, and writes `MASTRA_PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN` + `MASTRA_PROJECT_ID` to `.env`. The generated project already registers a `MastraPlatformExporter`, so no additional setup is needed to start sending traces.

`MASTRA_PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN` replaces `MASTRA_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN`. The old name is still read by the exporter for backwards compatibility but is deprecated.

If provisioning fails (e.g., the platform is unreachable), the command falls back to writing placeholder env vars with instructions.

Both commands also accept `--observability` / `--no-observability` flags for non-interactive use, and `--observability-project <name>` to bypass the project picker.
